   "Speaker 1:  Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market . ",
   "Speaker 2:  Do you sell direct to shops ? ",
   "Speaker 1:  Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen . ",
   "Speaker 2:  Do you keep a stock of these things ? ",
   "Speaker 1:  In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course . ",
   "Speaker 2:  That is , your commission . ",
   "Speaker 1:  Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal . ",
   "Speaker 2:  Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission . ",
   "Speaker 1:  The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much . ",
   "Speaker 2:  According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ? ",
   "Speaker 1:  We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with . ",
   "Speaker 2:  We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ... ",
   "Speaker 1:  Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ? ",
   "Speaker 2:  Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect . ",
   "Speaker 1:  Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products . ",
   "Speaker 2:  Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details . ",
   "Speaker 1:  Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ? ",
   "Speaker 2:  Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction . ",

Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled . ",

   "Speaker 2:  That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store .
